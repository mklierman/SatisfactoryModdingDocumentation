= Registry

SML provides a few registry mechanisms for quick and easy content management.

== Remote Call Object Registry

The `Remote Call Object Registry` is a
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_instance_module_ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance]
xref:Development/ModLoader/Subsystems.adoc[Subsystem]
that automatically registers all listed remote call objects in the Satisfactory Player Character.

You can use the `Register Remote Call Object`-Function to add the class of a remote call object to the registry
so that it gets automatically registered in the player.

== Subsystem Holder Registry

The `Subsystem Holder Registry` ia a 
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_instance_module_ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance]
xref:Development/ModLoader/Subsystems.adoc[Subsystem]
that automatically registers all listed subsystem holders to the mod loader lifecycle.
The holders are then manged by SML and called at the correct times.

You can use the `Register Subsystem Holder`-Function to add the class of a subsystem holder to the registry.

== Mod Key Bind Registry

The `Mod Key Bind Registry` is a blueprint function library that provides a couple of functions
that allow you to easily add your own key bindings and axis bindings to the game via the UE
https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Input/index.html?utm_source=editor&utm_medium=docs[ActionMappings]
and AxisMappings system.

Since we don't have direct access to the Satisfactory project file, we can't add them directly to the
Project Settings, so instead we add them through this SML registry.

Users of your mod can edit these keybinds from the in-game keybindings screen in the options.
Your keybinds will show up with the given display name grouped in a category with your mod's name,
and their set values will persist between sessions of the game.

In order to get the keybinds to show up correctly inside the Blueprint editor,
you will still have to add them to the Bindings section found at Project Settings > Engine > Input > Bindings.

Once the keybinds are set up, they should show up when you type their name into the new node dialog, provided you are in a blueprint derived from a class that can receive input calls.
For example, if you named a keybind `DocMod.DebugPrint` then you can search
`DocMod.DebugPrint` and the node for the DocMod.DebugPrint Action Event will show up.

=== `RegisterModKeyBind(String ModReference, InputActionKeyMapping KeyMapping, Text DisplayName)`
Register a given key mapping and associates it with mod reference provided.
The action name (part of the `InputActionKeyMapping`) should be unique and start with a "ModReference."
prefix to avoid conflicts with other mods.
This function will throw an exception if the action name doesn't start with the prefix described above.
You can only register two keys with the same name.
One of them should be a keyboard action and another is a gamepad action (optional).

To register a key binding within Blueprints, simply add it to the ```Mod Key Bindings``` property of your mod's Game Instance Module.

=== `RegisterModAxisBind(String ModReference, InputAxisKeyMapping PositiveAxisMapping, InputAxisKeyMapping NegativeAxisMapping, Text PositiveDisplayName, Text NegativeDisplayName)`
Registers the given axis key mappings and associate them with the given mod reference.
The axis names (part of the `InputAxisKeyMapping`s) should be unique and start with a "ModReference."
prefix to avoid conflicts with other mods.
This function will an throw exception if the axis names don't start with the prefix described above.
Both axis mappings should have equal action names, too.
Satisfactory requires all axis binds to have 2 keys with opposite directions, and they will be displayed as 2 keys in the control options too.
You can only register two axis binding pairs.
One of them should be a keyboard axis and the other a gamepad axis (optional).

== Mod Content Registry
The Mod Content Registry is a xref:Development/ModLoader/Subsystems.adoc[subsystem]
that manages registration and lifetime of any kind of modded content.

All content you create and add with your mod that is of supported types
should be registered through this registry.
Meaning, you should **not** register it yourself in the games subsystems.

This essential in ensuring that it is correctly saved, loaded, and identified by the game and other mods.

If you don't need any dynamic behaviors the Mod Content Registry provides,
you should use properties in your
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_world_module_ugameworldmodule[InitGameWorld]
module instance instead of calling methods on this object directly.

[WARNING]
====
Content can only be registered before a save is loaded.
After that moment, the registry is frozen and no changes can be made after that!
====

Registered content is then also tracked automatically for changes/overwrites if possible.
By f.e. looking up Alpakit overwrite data.

You can use it's `Get(UObject*)`-Function to get a instance of the registry.

=== `RegisterSchematic(FName ModReference, TSubclassOf<UFGSchematic> Schematic)`
Registers the given schematic.

It additionally also registers referenced recipes and items automatically.

You must also provide your mod reference so the content can get associated properly.

=== `RegisterResearchTree(FName ModReference, TSubclassOf<UFGResearchTree> ResearchTree)`
Registers the given research tree.

It additionally also registers referenced schematics automatically.

You must also provide your mod reference so the content can get associated properly.

Nodes should be type of default BPD_ResearchTreeNode.

=== `RegisterRecipe(FName ModReference, TSubclassOf<UFGRecipe> Recipe)`
Registers the given recipe.

It additionally also registers referenced items automatically.

You must also provide your mod reference so the content can get associated properly.

=== `RegisterResourceSinkItemPointTable(FName ModReference, UDataTable* PointTable)`
Registers the given resource sink item point table.

You must also provide your mod reference so the content can get associated properly.

=== `TArray<FItemRegistrationInfo> GetLoadedItemDescriptors()`
Returns a list of all currently loaded item descriptors.

=== `TArray<FItemRegistrationInfo> GetObtainableItemDescriptors()`

=== `FItemRegistrationInfo GetItemDescriptorInfo(TSubclassOf<UFGItemDescriptor> ItemDescriptor)`
Returns the registration info of the given item descriptor.

=== `TArray<FRecipeRegistrationInfo> GetRegisteredRecipes()`
